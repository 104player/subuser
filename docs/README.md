In order to build the docs, you must have the subuser-standard within the docs directory.  In order to get the subser-standard issue:

    git clone https://github.com/subuser-security/subuser-standard.git

To build the docs use:

    make shell
    make html

Once you are inside the "make shell" you can run `make html` as many times as you wish.
